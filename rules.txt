Initial Setup

    The board is filled with a checkered pattern of Red and Blue checkers.
    Red checkers are placed on alternating squares starting from the top-left corner.
    Blue checkers occupy the other squares.
    For a 6Ã—6 board:
        Rows 1, 3, 5 (odd rows): Red checkers are on squares 1, 3, 5, while Blue checkers are on squares 2, 4, 6.
        Rows 2, 4, 6 (even rows): Blue checkers are on squares 1, 3, 5, while Red checkers are on squares 2, 4, 6.
    All checkers are in stacks of like-colored checkers.
    A singleton is a stack with a height of 1.
    Gameplay

    Two players: Red and Blue.
    Turns: Players alternate turns, starting with Red.
    A player must move one of their stacks if possible.
    If no moves are available, the player skips their turn.
    At least one player always has a move available.
    Draws cannot occur.

Moves

Three types of moves are allowed: Positional, Stacking, and Capturing.
All moves are orthogonal (horizontal or vertical), and each stack moves one square.
1. Positional Move:

    Move a stack to an unoccupied adjacent square.
    The move must reduce the Manhattan distance to the nearest stack (regardless of color or height).
    Only stacks without adjacent stacks can perform positional moves.

2. Stacking Move:

    Move a stack onto an adjacent friendly stack.
    The destination stack must have an equal or greater height.

3. Capturing Move:

    Capture an adjacent enemy stack.
    The enemy stack must have an equal or smaller height.

Objective

    Capture all enemy checkers to win.
